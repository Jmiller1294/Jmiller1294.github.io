I am humbled to have gotten this far in the Flatiron School. After almost a year of hard work, perseverance, and believing in myself, I have gotten to the end of the Software Engineering course. During my time at Flatiron I have aquired 5 major skills that I will be taking with me into my future career.

###  Be Patient

Coding is one of the hardest things I have learned to do, it requires patience and critical thinking on a higher level than most things. The Software Engineering field is evolving at a fast pace. You have to be willing to take the time to learn new things and not think that you will grasp everything overnight.Things may not seem like they make sense in the beginning, but if you stick with it things start to connect. Abstract concepts start to come together.

### Don't Overthink

Initially when I ran into a problem my first response was to overthink and try to search everywhere for the error. Most of the time the error is very simple and right in front of your face. What helped me was slowing down and trying to picture the flow of my code. Even the best coders make errors, but the best ones have effective methods at spotting them. Reading documentation and going back a couple lessons to reread the lesson to get a deeper understanding of the labs helped me alot more than just randomly searching for my errors.

### Read Documentation

In the beginning I used to skip through some of the documentation and go straight through the lessons. I realized later on in the curriculum that this was a mistake. Reading documentation is very important because it allows you to get a more detailed understanding of how things work in the labs. There are a lot more examples in the documentation than in the lessons also. The lessons are meant to give you a more general overview while the documentation is more specific.

### Ask For Help

One of the most important things I appreciate about the Flatiron School was the resources that were available for students to ask for help. I got stuck many times with setting up my environment, working on hard labs, and while working on my project. I was able to ask for help from instructors, fellow classmates and the Flatiron community. Coding is a team sport and it requires people working together to solve problems. No question is a dumb question and being able to ask for help earlier can make a huge difference in your progress as a student.

### More to Learn

Now that I have completed all the necessary material to graduate, one of the major things I have learned is that there is always more to learn. I have learned so much, but this is only a fraction of all the tools and information that are at a Software Engineers disposale. Languages, libraries and frameworks are always being updated, so there is always something new to learn.
