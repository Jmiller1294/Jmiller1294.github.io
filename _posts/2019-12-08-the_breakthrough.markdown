The stress level around this project is hard to explain.You know you have been given all of tools to complete the task , but then you just freeze up.Its like training for a championship game and choking.I have to believe in myself! Then a voice in my head says everybody starts somewhere.I have flashbacks of videos where veteran programmers even get lost.This is my first semester as a computer science student and a flatiron school student,and lo and behold I have two projects due the same week!!One in java and one in ruby!Oh no!!

**The First Breakthrough.**
I have no idea where to start! Thats the feeling that I had when I first started my Cli Project. I knew that I wanted to create a weather app that allowed the user to enter a city and recieve a detailed weather report. Ok now what? I was lost , and felt like I would never get this done on time.What am i missing?I was able to choose an api to get my project, started now what??I  watched a couple videos on scrapping I tried to replay the videos over and over again to figure out what I was missing.Aha!!The first breakthough. I have to set up my bin file to run as my environment, and use it to start my program.


**The Second Breakthrough.**
I had no idea what gems to install so I went to the ruby documentation. I realized I needed the httparty gem to retrieve data from the api, and the pry gem to use binding.pry. I used binding.pry on my response variable and there it was a hash of all of the information that I needed for my program. Now if I could only figure out how to get those values. I was stuck, I had no idea where to go. I remembered that good programers don't always rely on their memory, they look up documentation to solve most of their problems. I was able to use documentation to figure out how to iterate over my new response hash and get the values I needed. 


**The Third Breakthrough.**
The hardest part for me was trying to link all of the classes together. I decided to start seeing each class as similiar to a body part on a human. Each body part has a particular function. For my program the Api class was responsible for retrieving the data. The Forecast class was responsible for turning that data into attributes of an object, and storing those objects .The Cli class was responsible for taking in user input and creating an interface for the user to retrive those objects. Once I changed my mindset to this type of thinking I was able to make alot of progress.


**The Fourth Breakthrough.**
I finally got my programm working, typed in the input and walla!! Weather for the city.Oh wait!
How do I take the input that the user gave me and use that to make the program behave in a certain way? For instance if the user enters the wrong city, how do I reprompt them to enter another city, when the api returns a nil value. I had no clue.My program was breaking when I put in the wrong input. With a some help from my cohort lead  Z, I was able to return a error message instead of breaking my program.


**Lesson Learned.**
Finally after a week and a half my program was running smoothly and doing everything I wanted to do. I had completed my first challange. This project taught me that no matter how complex the task seems,  if you break into parts and take it a little at a time instead of looking at it as a whole. You can accomlish things that you never thought you could.

On to the next project!!!
